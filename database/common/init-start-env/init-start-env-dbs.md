# Initialize Environment

## Introduction

In this lab we will review and startup all components required to successfully run this workshop.

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes.

### Objectives
- Initialize the workshop environment.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- An Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Prepare Setup 
    - Lab: Environment Setup

## Task 1: Validate That Required Processes are Up and Running.

**Note:** All screenshots for SSH terminal type tasks featured throughout this workshop were captured using the *MobaXterm* SSH Client as described in this step. As a result when executing such tasks from within the graphical remote desktop session, skip steps requiring you to login as user *oracle* using *sudo su - oracle*, the reason being that the remote desktop session is under user *oracle*.

1. Now with access to your remote desktop session, proceed as indicated below to validate your environment before you start executing the subsequent labs. The following Processes should be up and running:

    - Database Listener
    - Database Servers (emcdb and cdb1)

2. Open a terminal session and proceed as indicated below to validate the services:

    - Database services (All databases and Standard Listener)

        ```
        <copy>
        sudo systemctl status oracle-database
        </copy>
        ```

        ![DB Service Status](images/db-service-status.png "DB Service Status")

3. If you see questionable output(s), failure or down component(s), restart the corresponding service(s) accordingly

    - Database and Listener

        ```
        <copy>
        sudo systemctl restart oracle-database
        </copy>
        ```

 You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
